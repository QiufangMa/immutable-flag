--- abstract

   This document defines a way to formally document existing behavior,
   implemented by servers in production, on the immutability of some
   system configuration nodes, using a YANG metadata annotation called
   "immutable" to flag which nodes are immutable.

   Clients may use "immutable" annotations provided by the server, to
   know beforehand why certain otherwise valid configuration requests
   will cause the server to return an error.

   The immutable flag is descriptive, documenting existing behavior, not
   proscriptive, dictating server behavior.

# Introduction

   This document defines a way to formally document as a YANG metadata
   annotation an existing model handling behavior that has been used by
   multiple standard organizations and vendors.  It is the aim to create
   one single standard solution for documenting non-modifiable system
   data declared as configuration, instead of the multiple existing
   vendor and organization specific solutions.  See {{implementations}} for
   existing implementations.

   YANG {{!RFC7950}} is a data modeling language used to model both state
   and configuration data, based on the "config" statement.  However,
   there exists some system configuration data that cannot be modified
   by the client (it is immutable), but still needs to be declared as
   "config true" to:

   * allow configuration of data nodes under immutable lists or containers;

   * place "when", "must" and "leafref" constraints between configuration
   and immutable data nodes;

   * ensure the existence of specific list entries that are provided and
   needed by the system, while additional list entries can be created,
   modified or deleted.

   If the server always rejects the client attempts to override
   immutable system configuration {{?I-D.ietf-netmod-system-config}}
   because it internally thinks it immutable, it should document this
   towards the clients in a machine-readable way rather than writing as
   plain text in the description statement.

   This document defines a way to formally document existing behavior,
   implemented by servers in production, on the immutability of some
   system configuration nodes, using a YANG metadata annotation {{!RFC7952}}
   called "immutable" to flag which nodes are immutable.

   This document does not apply to the server not having any immutable
   system configuration.  While in some cases immutability may be
   needed, it also has disadvantages, therefore it SHOULD be avoided
   wherever possible.

   The following is a list of already implemented and potential use
   cases:

   * UC1  Modeling of server capabilities
   * UC2  HW based auto-configuration
   * UC3  Predefined administrator roles
   * UC4  Declaring immutable system configuration from an LNE's perspective

   {{use-cases}} describes the use cases in detail.

   The following terms are defined in {{!RFC6241}}:

   * configuration data

   The following terms are defined in {{!RFC7950}}:

   * data node
   * leaf
   * lea-list

   * anyxml
   * interior node
   * data tree

   The following terms are defined in {{!RFC8341}}:

   * access operation

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   * immutable flag:
   : A read-only state value the server provides to describe immutability
   of the data, which is conveyed via a YANG metadata annotation called
   "immutable" with a boolean value.

# Applicability

   While immutable flag applies to all configuration nodes, its value "true"
   can only be used for system configuration.

   The immutable annotation information is also visible in read-only
   datastores like \<system\> (if exists), \<intended\> and \<operational\>
   when a "with-immutable" parameter is carried (see {{with-immutable}}),
   however this only serves as descriptive information about the
   instance node itself, but has no effect on the handling of the read-
   only datastore.

   Configuration data must have the same immutability in different
   writable datastores.  The immutability of data nodes is protocol and
   user independent.  The immutability and configured value of an
   existing node MUST only change via  software upgrade or hardware
   resource/license change.

# Solution Overview

   Immutable configuration can only be created by the system regardless
   of the implementation of \<system\> {{?I-D.ietf-netmod-system-config}}.
   Immutable configuration is present in \<system\> (if implements). Immutable
   configuration does not appear in \<running\> unless it is copied explicitly or
   automatically (e.g., by "resolve-system" parameter) {{?I-D.ietf-netmod-system-config}}.

   A client may create/delete immutable nodes with same values as found
   in \<system\> (if exists) in read-write configuration datastore (e.g.,
   \<candidate\>, \<running\>), which merely mean making immutable nodes
   visible/invisible in read-write configuration datastore
   (e.g., \<candidate\>, \<running\>).

# "Immutable" Metadata Annotation

## Definition

   The "immutable" metadata annotation takes as an value which is a
   boolean type,  returned as requested by the client using a "with-immutable"
   parameter (see {{with-immutable}}). If the "immutable" metadata annotation for
   system configuration  is not specified, the default "immutable" value is the
   same as the immutability of its parent node in the data tree.  The immutable
   metadata annotation value for a top-level system-provided instance node is
   "false" if not specified.

   Note that "immutable" metadata annotation is used to annotate data node
   instances.  A list may have multiple entries/instances in the data tree,
   "immutable" can annotate some of the instances as read-only, while others are
   read-write. The immutable flag has no bearing on the order of the
   list/leaf-list entries, a parent container of the list/leaf-list may have
   the "immutable" annotation, but that means the same as each individual
   list/leaf-list entry being annotated.

## "with-immutable" Parameter {#with-immutable}

   The YANG model defined in this document (see {{module}}) augments the
   \<get-config\>, \<get\> operation defined in {{!RFC6241}}, and the \<get-data\>
   operation defined in {{!RFC8526}} with a new parameter named "with-immutable".
   When this parameter is present, it requests that the server includes
   "immutable" metadata annotations in its response.

   This parameter may be used for read-only configuration datastores,
   e.g., \<system\> (if exists), \<intended> and <operational\>, but the
   "immutable" metadata annotation returned indicates the immutability
   towards read-write configuration datastores, e.g., \<startup\>,
   \<candidate\> and \<running\>.  

   Note that "immutable" metadata annotation MUST NOT be included in a
   response unless a client explicitly requests them with a "with-immutable"
   parameter.

# Use of Immutable Flag for Different Statements

   This section defines what the immutable flag means to the client for
   each instance of YANG data node statement.

   Throughout this section, the word "change" refers to create, update, and delete.

## The "leaf" Statement

   When a leaf node instance is immutable, its value cannot change.

## The "leaf-list" Statement

   When a leaf-list node instance is immutable, its value cannot change.

   The immutable annotation attached to the individual leaf-list instance
   provides immutability with respect to the instance itself without any
   bearing on the leaf-list entries ordering and addition of new entries.

   Note that if leaf-list inherits immutability from an ancestor
   (e.g., container), it means that the leaf-list as a whole cannot change:
   entries cannot be added, removed, or reordered, in case the leaf-list is
   "ordered-by user".

## The "container" Statement

   When a container node instance is immutable, it cannot change, unless
   the immutability of its descendant node is toggled.

   By default, as with all interior nodes, immutability is recursively
   applied to descendants (see {{interior}}).

## The "list" Statement

   When a list node instance is immutable, it cannot change, unless the
   immutability of its descendant node is toggled, per the description
   elsewhere in this section.

   By default, as with all interior nodes, immutability is recursively
   applied to descendants (see {{interior}}).  

   The immutable annotation attached to the individual list instance provides
   immutability with respect to the instance itself without any bearing on the
   list entries ordering and addition of new entries. Note that if leaf-list
   inherits immutability from an ancestor (e.g., a container), it means that
   the leaf-list as a whole cannot change: entries cannot be added, removed,
   or reordered, in case the leaf-list is "ordered-by user".

## The "anydata" Statement

   When an anydata node instance is immutable, it cannot change. Additionally,
   as with all interior nodes, immutability is recursively applied to
   descendants (see {{interior}}).

## The "anyxml" Statement

   When an "anyxml" node instance is immutable, it cannot change. Additionally,
   as with all interior nodes, immutability is recursively applied to
   descendants (see {{interior}}).

# Immutability of Interior Nodes {#interior}

   Immutability is a conceptual operational state value that is
   recursively applied to descendants, which may reset the immutability
   state as needed, thereby affecting their descendants.  There is no limit
   to the number of times the immutability state may change in a data tree.

   If the "immutable" metadata annotation for returned child nodes are omitted,
   it has the same immutability as its parent node. The immutability of top
   hierarchy of returned nodes is false by default. Servers may suppress the
   annotation if it is inherited from its parent node or uses the default value
   as the top-level node, but are not precluded from returning the annotation
   on every single element.

   Servers MUST ignore any immutable metadata annotation sent from the client.

   For example, given the following application configuration XML snippets:

~~~~
<applications im:immutable="false">
<application im:immutable="true">
  <name>ssh</name>
  <protocol>tcp</protocol>
  <port-number im:immutable="false">22</port-number>
</application>
<application im:immutable="false">
  <name>my-ssh</name>
  <protocol>tcp</protocol>
  <port-number>10022</port-number>
</application>
</applications>
~~~~

   The "application" list entry named "ssh" is immutable="true", but its child
   node "port-number" has the immutable="false" (thus the client can override
   this value).  The other child node (e.g., "protocol") not specifying its
   immutability explicitly inherits immutability from its parent node thus is
   also immutable="true". The "immutable" metadata attribute for applications
   container instance is "false", which is also its default value as the
   top-level element, and thus can be omitted. The "immutable" metadata
   attribute for application list entry named "ssh" is explicitly set as "true",
   but its child node "port-number" reset the immutable attribute as "false"
   (thus the client can override this value).  The other child node (e.g., "protocol")
   not specifying its immutability explicitly inherits immutability from its
   parent node thus is also immutable="true". The "immutable" metadata attribute
   for application list entry named "my-ssh" is "false", which is also its
   inherited value from its parent node, and thus can be omitted.

# System Configuration Interactions

   The system datastore is defined to hold system configuration provided
   by the device itself and make system configuration visible to clients
   in order for being referenced or configurable prior to present in
   \<operational\>.  However, the device may allow some system-initialized
   node to be overridden, while others may not.  System configuration
   exists regardless of whether \<system\> is implemented.

   This document defines a way to allow a server annotate instances of
   non-modifiable system configuration with metadata when system configuration
   is retrieved.  A client aware of the "immutable" annotation can explicitly
   ask the server to return it via the "with-immutable" parameter in the
   request, thus is able to avoid making unnecessary modification attempts
   to immutable configuration.  Legacy clients unaware of the "immutable"
   annotation don't see any changes and encounter an error as always.

# NACM Interactions

   The server rejects an operation request due to immutability when it
   tries to perform the operation on the request data.  It happens after
   any access control processing, if the Network Configuration Access
   Control Model (NACM) {{!RFC8341}} is implemented on a server.  For
   example, if an operation requests to override an immutable
   configuration data, but the server checks the user is not authorized
   to perform the requested access operation on the request data, the
   request is rejected with an "access-denied" error.

# Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a a metadata Annotation.
   These can be used to further restrict write access but cannot be used to
   extend access rights.

   This document does not define any protocol-accessible data nodes.

   Since immutable information is tied to applied configuration values,
   it is only accessible to clients that have the permissions to read the
   applied configuration values.

   The security considerations for the Defining and Using Metadata with
   YANG (see {{Section 9 of !RFC7952}}) apply to the metadata annotation
   defined in this document.

# Detailed Use Cases {#use-cases}

## UC1 - Modeling of server capabilities

   System capabilities might be represented as system-defined data nodes in
   the model.  Configurable data nodes might need constraints specified as
   "when", "must" or "path" statements to ensure that configuration is set
   according to the system's capabilities. For example,

   * A timer can support the values 1,5,8 seconds. This is defined in the
   leaf-list 'supported-timer-values'.

   * When the configurable 'interface-timer' leaf is set, it should be ensured
   that one of the supported values is used.  The natural solution would be to
   make the 'interface-timer' a leaf-ref pointing at the 'supported-timer-values'.

   However, this is not possible as 'supported-timer-values' must be
   read-only thus config=false while 'interface-timer' must be writable
   thus config=true.  According to the rules of YANG it is not allowed
   to put a constraint between config true and false data nodes.

   The solution is that the supported-timer-values data node in the YANG
   Model shall be defined as "config true" and shall also be marked with
   the "immutable" annotation  making it unchangeable.  After this the
   'interface-timer' shall be defined as a leaf-ref pointing at the
   'supported-timer-values'.

## UC2 - HW based auto-configuration - Interface Example

   {{?RFC8343}} defines a YANG data model for the management of network
   interfaces.  When a system-controlled interface is physically present,
   the system creates an interface entry with valid name and type
   values in \<system\> (if exists, see {{?I-D.ietf-netmod-system-config}}).

   The system-generated type value is dependent on and represents the HW
   present, and as a consequence cannot be changed by the client.  If a
   client tries to set the type of an interface to a value that can
   never be used by the system, the request will be rejected by the
   server.  The data is modelled as "config true" and should be annotated
   as immutable.

   Seemingly an alternative would be to model the list and these leaves
   as "config false", but that does not work because:

  * The list cannot be marked as "config false", because it needs to contain
  configurable child nodes, e.g., ip-address or enabled;

  * The key leaf (name) cannot be marked as "config false" as the list
  itself is config true;

  * The type cannot be marked "config false", because we MAY need to
  reference the type to make different configuration nodes
  conditionally available.

## UC3 - Predefined Administrator Roles

   User and group management is fundamental for setting up access
   control rules (see {{Section 2.5 of !RFC8341}}).

   A device may provide a predefined user account (e.g., a system
   administrator that is always available and has full privileges) for
   initial system set up and management of other users/groups.  It is
   possible that clients can define a new user/group and grant it
   particular privileges, but the predefined administrator account and
   its granted access cannot be modified.

## UC4 - Declaring immutable system configuration from an LNE's perspective

   An LNE (logical network element) is an independently managed virtual
   network device made up of resources allocated to it from its host or
   parent network device {{?RFC8530}}.  The host device may allocate some
   resources to an LNE, which from an LNE's perspective is provided by
   the system and may not be modifiable.

   For example, a host may allocate an interface to an LNE with a valid
   MTU value as its management interface, so that the allocated
   interface should then be accessible as the LNE-specific instance of
   the interface model.  The assigned MTU value is system-created and
   immutable from the context of the LNE.

# Existing Implementations {#implementations}

   There are already a number of full or partial implementations of
   immutability:

   * 3GPP TS 32.156 {{TS32.156}} and 28.623 {{TS28.623}}: Requirements
   and a partial solution

   * ITU-T using ONF TR-531 {{TR-531}} concept on information model level but
   no YANG representation.

   * Ericsson: requirements and solution

   * YumaPro: requirements and solution

   * Nokia: partial requirements and solution

   * Huawei: partial requirements and solution

   * Cisco using the concept at least in some YANG modules

   * Junos OS provides a hidden and immutable configuration group
   called junos-defaults
